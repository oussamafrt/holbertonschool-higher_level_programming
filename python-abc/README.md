# Python OOP - Abtract Class, Interface, Subclassing

## Introduction:
Welcome to this set of exercises aimed at honing your understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. Through these exercises, you will delve into abstract classes, interfaces, duck typing, and subclassing standard base classes among other crucial OOP concepts. By the end of these exercises, you should be proficient in employing OOP principles to design, implement, and test Python programs.

## Learning Objectives:
Abstract Classes: Understand and apply abstract classes to define common interfaces while enforcing certain levels of class completeness.
Interfaces and Duck Typing: Grasp the concept of interfaces and duck typing to ensure that objects adhere to a specific contract or protocol.
Subclassing Standard Base Classes: Learn to extend standard base classes like lists, dictionaries, and iterators to create custom data structures with specialized behavior.
Method Overriding: Employ method overriding to alter or enhance the behavior of base class methods.
Multiple Inheritance: Understand and apply multiple inheritance to form complex relationships between classes.
Mixins: Utilize mixins to compose behavior across unrelated classes.
